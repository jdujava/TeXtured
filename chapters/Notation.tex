% NOTE: since we are in the "frontmatter" part, we need to manually set headers

\begin{remark}
    This chapter is numbered (or perhaps more precisely \enquote{lettered}).
    This means that is appears in Table of Contents with its letter \enquote{\textbf{\textsf{N}}}, which also prefixes all numbering of environments in this chapter.

    On the other hand, \Nref{ch:Introduction} and \Nref{ch:Quick Summary} are unnumbered (or \enquote{unlettered}) in this sense.

\begin{example}[Usage of Mathematical Fonts]
    To make the text more readable and beautiful, we can use different types of mathematical fonts for different types of objects (striving to be at least somewhat consistent):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \(\bm{Bold}\) often for tensorial object (abstract index).
        \item \(\mathsf{Sans}\) for groups, certain spaces, or some operations/maps.
        \item \(\mathfrak{Fraktur}\) for algebras (and densities).
        \item \(\mathcal{C}a\ell\ell igraphic\) (available are only capital letters, and \(\ell\))
        \item \(\mathpzc{Calligraphic}\) (alternative font containing also lowercase letters)
        \item \(\mathbb{D}\)ouble-\(\mathbb{S}\)truck for fields like \(\R\), spaces like \(\Sphere^{n}\) and \(\CP^{n}\).
        \item \(\mathtt{Typewriter}\) for code functions, or other special objects. \qedhere
    \end{itemize}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    You can use \(\.\argument\.\) as an argument placeholder.
\end{example}
