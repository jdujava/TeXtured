%%% Find out the name of a glyph in LaTeX
%% based on https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/66302

%% To obtain PDF/A compliant PDF, we need to have Unicode mapping for all
%% glyphs used in the document. This can be done in LaTeX by using the
%% `\pdfglyphtounicode{<glyph_name>}{<Unicode_code_point>}` command.

%% Using the veraPDF output, locate the problematic glyph in the PDF file,
%% and insert it into the following minimal document.

%% Name of the problematic glyph can be found by generating the following PDF.
%% By disabling the PDF compression, we can inspect the whole PDF file as if
%% it were a text file. Searching for `CharSet` in the PDF file we can find
%% something like `/CharSet (/axisshort)`, which tells us that the glyph is
%% named `axisshort`.

%% Adequate Unicode code point can be found for example on the website
%% https://codepoints.net/. Since the glyph in question is used as a short
%% minus sign, we can search for `minus` and find the code point `U+2212`.

%% The corresponding glyph to unicode mapping is then simply
%% `\pdfglyphtounicode{axisshort}{2212}`.

\pdfcompresslevel=0 % disable compression, such that we can inspect the PDF
\documentclass[a6paper,12pt]{article}

%% Load all the packages/fonts containing the problematic glyph
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
\DeclareMathSymbol{\shortminus}{\mathbin}{AMSa}{"39}
\NewDocumentCommand{\shortminusone}{}{\mspace{-1.2mu}\shortminus\mspace{-1.5mu} 1}

\begin{document}
%% INCLUDE HERE THE PROBLEMATIC GLYPH (and ideally nothing else), for example:
\(\shortminusone\) % This contains the problematic glyph
\end{document}
