Do you care in the slightest about what your readers think about your document,
and by proxy about you and your competence level? If yes, then a classy,
typographically professional layout and structured, clear, and revealing content
can only help. This template tries to aid you in both of these endeavors.

Here’s what the **TeXtured** Template offers:
- ✨ **typographically elegant layout** with various features to make your document stand out
- 🧙 **clean code structure** with plenty of comments to help you easily customize the template to your needs
- 🔗 **seamless GitHub integration** (via GitHub Actions) to streamline version control and collaboration
- 📄 **PDF/A compliance** and *front matter* supporting theses at [MFF](https://www.mff.cuni.cz/en) 🎓

To learn more about the design principles behind `TeXtured` and its capabilities, look at the
[<img align="center" alt="TeXtured Manual" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/TeXtured-Manual%E2%80%89%F0%9F%93%93-blue?color=ccfaff">](https://jdujava.github.io/TeXtured/thesis.pdf).
It showcases the features of `TeXtured` template and provides a guide on how to use them.

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that the documentation is still a work-in-progress 🚧,
> with more guides and explanations to come.

> [!TIP]
> If you find something interesting or useful, but adopting the whole template
> is simply too much, feel free to just copy and use relevant parts of the code.
> Also, consider starring (⭐) the repository to help others find it!

## 🏗️ Building

Be sure to have all the dependencies installed — at least the `LaTeX` build tools, see below — and run
```sh
latexmk thesis
```
in the root directory of the repository to build the document.

> [!TIP]
> If you prefer to use 🍃 `Overleaf`, you can find the `TeXtured` template
> [<img align="center" alt="Overleaf TeXtured Template" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Overleaf-TeXtured-blue?color=ccffd2&logo=overleaf">](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/textured/zwtzzwgddbsh)
> there as well.
> Note that releases `v1.3.0` and later depend on [`keytheorems`](https://github.com/mbertucci47/keytheorems) package,
> which is not yet available on 🍃 `Overleaf` (you can however upload `keytheorems.sty` manually).


## 📦 Software Dependencies

LaTeX build tools:
- `latexmk` - LaTeX build tool
- `pdflatex`/`lualatex` - LaTeX engine (you can choose one in `.latexmkrc`)
- `biber` - bibliography processing tool for `biblatex`

> [!WARNING]
> To properly build the document, the template requires `TeX Live` 2024 or later (otherwise, some packages may not be available, or you may encounter some bugs).
> Using the latest version of `TeX Live` is highly recommended, which is used in the GitHub Actions workflow to build
> [<img align="center" alt="TeXtured Manual" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/TeXtured-Manual%E2%80%89%F0%9F%93%93-blue?color=ccfaff">](https://jdujava.github.io/TeXtured/thesis.pdf).

> [!NOTE]
> Some scripts assume `linux` environment. These include:
> - generation of directory structure for `aux_dir` (dependencies are `sed`, `xargs`)
> - vector figure generation (together with watermark)
>     + need to enable `--shell-escape` in `.latexmkrc`
>     + `inkscape` - vector graphics (and SVG to PDF conversion)
>     + `perl` - disabling `/Interpolation` in PDFs generated by `inkscape`
>     + `sed`, `uconv` - substituting placeholders in PDF watermark
>     + `ghostscript` - injecting `postscript` watermark into PDF

Version control (optional):
- `git` - the preferred version control system
- `git-lfs` - [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/) - for storing PDFs, figures, etc.
